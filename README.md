Poetry Made to Enlighten and Inspire

Sometimes the mind is the only salvation from within, whenever the mind cannot get it from without. However, I'm more of a self-made computer scientist, than I am a self-made poet. I don't have very much of this at all. What I have here is what you get, until I come up with more as I go through life. Poetry isn't something that everyone has control over. poetry needs a credible, critical reason to be written down onto paper. Like, for example: You feel sad and abandoned by everyone, you thought loved you. Or you saw something in your dreams that amazed you, or dazzled upon something that triggered you to write that poem down onto paper. Poetry is written best, when its got feelings of whatever you feel inside you. First, write all your thoughts down, then have fun putting them all back together for the whole world to read... Just remember, they want to read your thoughts, through the actions you took to cause you to write that wonderful piece of poetry in motion. They don't want empty words, that posses no actions whatsoever behind their meaning. They want absolute truth with absolute reason. Get right to the point...
