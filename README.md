Poetry Made to Enlighten and Inspire

My Best Poetry by Joseph C. Richardson

Sometimes the mind is the only salvation from within, whenever the mind cannot get it from without. However, I'm more of a self-made computer scientist, than I am a self-made poet. I don't have very much of this at all. What I have here is what you get, until I come up with more as I go through life. Poetry isn't something that everyone has control over. poetry needs a credible, critical reason to be written down onto paper. Like, for example: You feel sad and abandoned by everyone, you thought loved you. Or you saw something in your dreams that amazed you, or dazzled upon something that triggered you to write that poem down onto paper. Poetry is written best, when its got feelings of whatever you feel inside you. First, write all your thoughts down, then have fun putting them all back together for the whole world to read...

Just remember, they want to read your thoughts, through the actions you took to cause you to write that wonderful piece of poetry in motion. They don't want empty words, that posses no actions whatsoever behind their meaning. They want absolute truth with absolute reason. Get right to the point...

ASCRIPTION

The ascription of the so-called meaning of life and how it's supposed to be
will never find a unified agreement of what life is supposed to be and what
life is not supposed to be. Life is not a one size, fits all scheme and the only
thing certain in life is uncertainty. What is the true meaning of life? What is
the true meaning of truth? Which came first, the chicken or the egg? The true
meaning of life might not have any subscriptive, purposeful meaning at all.
The superior Gods worshipped today will become the inferior Gods, unworshipped
tomorrow. What life conceals may never be revealed; we grow, we live and
we die. Accept it. So live in the moment, because life is about living in the
ever now and ever new...

The Guilt Snake

The Guilt Snake is a creature, unlike no other. The Guilt Snake is an extremely sly,
opportunistic creature, that stalks and hunts its prey from within the soul. It lives
and thrives to constantly constrict it; to crush it, until it eventually consumes the
soul. The Guilt Snake seeks out those who carry self guilt for things they didn't do
wrong, for things they didn't do right. Once the Guilt Snake finds its prey, it takes
its sweet time to consume it. Although at the same time, the Guilt Snake constricts
and fills its prey with self guilt. And if not treated in time, the Guilt Snake will
not only destroy everything in its prey. It will eventually destroy its soul. And the
only way to destroy the Guilt Snake, is to forgive yourself as well as forgiveness for
others, who had done you wrong. The Guilt Snake can strike at any moment, deeply from
within, and without warning. If you dwell on self guilt, the Guilt Snake will quietly
sneak and slither into you to consume you, until you eventually become... The Guilt Snake.
